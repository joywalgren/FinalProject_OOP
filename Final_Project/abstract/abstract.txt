This project focuses on developing an interactive Battleship game using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The game will be played against a computer-controlled AI opponent and will include a menu system where users can select difficulty levels, view records, and manage user information.

The implementation will utilize classes and objects to represent essential game components such as the board and player, ensuring a modular and maintainable code structure. The AI opponent will follow a simple strategy to create an engaging challenge for players. Additionally, ASCII art will enhance the visual experience, making the game more immersive.

Our goal is to create an efficient, well-structured, and interactive game that demonstrates fundamental OOP principles while remaining simple and enjoyable for students.
