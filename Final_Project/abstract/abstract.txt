This project focuses on developing an interactive Battleship game using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The game will be played against an AI opponent and will include a menu system where users can select difficulty levels, view records, and manage user information. The implementation will utilize classes and objects to represent essential game components such as the board and player, ensuring a modular and maintainable code structure. The AI opponent will follow a simple strategy to create an engaging challenge for players. Additionally, ASCII arts will enhance the visual experience, making the game more immersive. The project aims to create an efficient, well-structured, and interactive game that demonstrates fundamental software engineering and OOP principles, unit testing, and appropriate design patterns while maintaining intuitive user interface to make the game fun for end users.
